# Seeing Korea: Image Generation, Processing and Computer Vision

## 1. Image Data Generation & Manipulation & Processing
1. `numpy` array
2. Image data format & indexing
3. Basic image data maipulation
    - pixel-based plotting, line segment drawing
    - drawing basic primitives: polygons, circles, etc.
4. Video data manipulation and visualization
4. 2D rigid transformations & rendering
5. Video tracking a rectangluar pattern.
6. 2D projective geometry and transformations

## 2. Image Processing and Visual Effects
1. movie bar-code
2. chroma-keying and digital matting
3. Fractalius effect by Gabor filtering
4. Filter effects by morphological operations

## 2. Geometric Computer Vision
1. 3D geometric transformations and Kinematics
2. Imaging model: Pin-hole camera model
3. Camera calibration & lens distortion correction
4. Drawing 3D wireframe primitives
5. From 2D to 3D through multiple view analysis
6. Stereo vision system
7. Video processing for camera tracking
8. 3D point cloud visualization
