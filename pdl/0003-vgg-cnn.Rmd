#  VGG Network & Convolution

- [Image Net Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/)
    - Number of object classes: 200 (ILSVRC 2014)

- VGG was at the 1st place on image localization - finding a bounding box.
- 2nd place on image classification, predicting a category label, such as 'cat' of 'dog'.


Mostly, VGG16 is utilized for image classification nowadays; I don't know why.

```{r vgg16-diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='VGG-16 Network'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/vgg16.png')
```

```{r vgg16-flow, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='VGG-16 Network Flow'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/vgg16-flowgraph.png')
```
