# Prerequisites {-}

* Theory should be studied whatever you want to do with it.

* Each chapter is tried to be self-contained and concise.

## Install

1. pythron 3.6 or higher.
    - `pip` command!
2. pytorch 1.0 , Keras with tensorflow 2.0, but no peculiar function is used. So previous versions should work.
3. Editors: vscode, jupyter-lab
```
$ pip install jupyterlab
```
4. Linux mainly, but windows 10 should be OK. The editors provide good environments for both of the operating systems.
5. Google colab, kaggle.com



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
