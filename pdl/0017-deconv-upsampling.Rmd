# Transposed Convolution &  Upsampling+Conv

- [Up-sampling with Transposed Convolution, Naoki Shibuya, in towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/up-sampling-with-transposed-convolution-9ae4f2df52d0)
    - Conv kernel may be reshaped into a 2D matrix, input reshaped to 1D vector, output reshaped to 1D vector; then the convolution operation is a matrix-vector multiplication
    - Transposed Conv: input is multiplied by the transposed matrix of the conv kernel to produce output of a larger dimension.

    - Better to use NN upsampling followed by convolution
