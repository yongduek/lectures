# Convolution is a Key Element of Deep NN

## Filtering with 2D Convolution Kernel

- Apply a 2D convolution kernel to an image.

```{python, code=readLines('python/torch-conv.py')}
```


## Supervised Learning for A Convolution Kernel

- Input is a gray image.
- Output is its SobelY result.
- NN is predicted to be learning the SobelY kernel.

```{python, code=readLines('python/torch-conv-learn.py')}
```
