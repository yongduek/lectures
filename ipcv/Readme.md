# Image Processing and Computer Vision with python and opencv library

1. Install `opencv`, `numpy`, etc. Use anaconda if you have no idea.
1. Use `numpy` for image data container
1. File write/read
1. Define an image memory, drawing a red color pixel, write it to a png/bmp/gif/jpg file. Display it with `gimp` or `photoshop`, and observe what you did.
1. Draw a line from $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$, or $(c_0, r_0)$ to $(c_1, r_1)$.
1. Think about drawing a line without a bug, a good looking line.
1. Draw a wire-frame triangle. Triangle is a convex polygon.
1. Draw a filled triangle. How?
1. Draw regular polygons and a circle.
1. Draw filled polygons.
2. Pixel-based image processing: Negation, r->g->b->r, color-space reduction (8bit -> 4bit), bit-plane images
1. gamma correction, color histogram
