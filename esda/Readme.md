# Introduction to Exploratory & Statistical Data Analysis

- This course introduces fundamental concepts and methods of modern computational statistical data analysis.
- The focus is on computational and exploratory data analysis
- Mainly with python codes with minimal mathematics and equations
- Example oriented or based on synthetic data

- Targeted for people who just learned first steps of python 
- developed for students in Global Korean Studies

Course Target:
- Learn basic approach of statistical thinking
- Sampling based approach (Computational random sampling)
- Basic probability distributions
- Basic Concept of Bayesian data analysis
- Regression analysis
- Null Hypothesis Testing for $z$-test and $t$-test, when time allows.
