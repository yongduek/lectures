## Blending Two Images

$$ I_B = \alpha I_1 + (1-\alpha) I_2 , \quad \alpha \in [0, 1]$$

Procedure:

1. prepare two image files
1. read the two files
1. set $\alpha$ to a value, e.g. $0.5$
1. compute the weighted sum of the two images
1. display the result

Notice:

- `np.uint8` is the type of a pixel value for display.
- BGR in OpenCV!

Try:

- make a video showing a progressive change from one image to another by increasing $\alpha$ from 0 to 1 smoothly.

```{python, code=readLines('python/blending.py') }
```


## Negative Film Effect

The image looks like a negative film in old days.

```{python, code=readLines('python/negative_film.py') }
```



## Histogram of RGB numpy image

```{python, eval=FALSE, code=readLines('python/numpy-hist.py')}
```

A result of the program is shown below.

```{python, echo=FALSE, code=readLines('python/numpy-hist.py')}
```


## Histogram Equalization

- Check [Wikipedia Histogram Equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization)

```{python, echo=FALSE, code=readLines('python/histogram_equalization.py')}
```


```{python, eval=FALSE, code=readLines('python/histogram_equalization.py')}
```




## Gamma Correction

- Read [Wikipedia Gamma Correction Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction)

```{python, code=readLines('python/gamma_correction.py')}
```





## HSV Color Space

HSV color representation is another popular way.
```{r hsvCylinder, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='HSV Cylinder'}
knitr::include_graphics('python/figures/hsv-cylinder.png')
```

```{python, code=readLines('python/rgb_hsv.py')}
```
