# Prerequisites

- I hope you have a little experience with computer programming languages such as python, C/C++, or Java.

- The order of presentation is arbitrary.

- Language stuff will be explained time to time. It is Java, but I will discuss how to make drawings without heavily resorting to basic Java language grammar. So understanding simple level programming sturcutre is enough to participate in this course.
