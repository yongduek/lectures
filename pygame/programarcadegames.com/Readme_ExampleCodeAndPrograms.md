There are many example programs available for download at:
http://ProgramArcadeGames.com/python_examples/en/python_examples.zip

Here is a brief description of what is available:

## 1.1 Text examples
Example programs that don't involve graphics:

1. Program that calculates miles-per-gallon.
    `calculate_miles_per_gallon.py`
2. Calculates the kinetic energy of an object.
`calculate_kinetic_energy.py`
3. Simple example if statements.
`if_statement_examples.py`
4. Simple example for loops.
`for_loop_examples.py`
5. Simple example while loops. (Chapter 4
`while_loop_examples.py`
6. Simple example for encrypting text.
`simple_encryption.py`
7. Simple example for decrypting text.
`simple_decryption.py`
8. Binary and linear searches.
`searching_example.py`
9. Property check examples.
`property_check_examples.py`


## 1.2 Graphics examples
Programs that show how to use graphics:

1. This opens up a blank pygame window. It is a good template to use when starting a new program.
`pygame_base_template.py`
2. This file demonstrates setting up a window and drawing rectangles, polygons, text, and other basic shapes.
`simple_graphics_demo.py`
3. See how to rotate text.
`text_rotate.py`
4. Demos all the commands in the draw module.
`draw_module_example.py`
5. Animate a bouncing rectangle around the screen.
`bouncing_rectangle.py`
6. Animate a several bouncing balls.
`bouncing_balls.py`
7. This shows how to use an array to animate and track multiple objects. In this case, snow flakes.
`animating_snow.py`
8. This file draws a snowman inside of a function. The program can then call the draw snowman function and draw several snowmen easily.
`functions_and_graphics.py`
9. Move an object with the mouse.
`move_mouse.py`
10. Move an object with the keyboard.
`move_keyboard.py`
11. Move an object with the game controller.
`move_game_controller.py`
12. Show how to read everything off a gamepad/controller/joystick.
`joystick_calls.py`
13. Display bitmapped images (png, jpg) to a screen. Make sounds.
`bitmapped_graphics.py`
14. Display a board based on a two-dimensional grid. Useful when creating games like tic-tac-toe, minesweeper, memory-match, connect-four, etc.
`array_backed_grid.py`
15. Display one or more pages of instruction before the game starts.
`instruction_screen.py`
16. Plays background music. When the music is over, an event is triggered and a different song starts. The music is included in the downloadable zip file, or you can follow the links in the comments to download the music.
`background_music.py`
17. Shows how to display a centered "Game Over" message, and stop game play when a game is over.
`game_over.py`
18. Display a line sweeping around in a circle like a radar.
`radar_sweep.py`
19. Count up and count down timers.
`timer.py`
20. Using recursion to make nested rectangles.
`recursive_rectangles.py`
21. Using recursion to make fractals.
`fractal.py`
22. Put a timer on the screen.
`timer.py`

## 1.3 Sprite examples
How to use sprites:

1. Move a sprite with the mouse and collect blocks.
`sprite_collect_blocks.py`
2. Same as collect blocks example, but all the sprites move.
`moving_sprites.py`
3. Same as collect blocks example, but you can move the sprite by clicking to pick them up.
`pick_up_blocks.py`
4. Rather than just move down, these sprites bounce.
`moving_sprites_bounce.py`
5. Prior example too boring? Get the sprites to move in circles.
`sprite_circle_movement.py`
6. Expands the prior example to show how to manage a game with levels. Level advances when all the blocks are cleared.
`sprite_collect_blocks_levels.py`
7. Same as sprite_collect_blocks.py but with a black circle instead of a block.
`sprite_collect_circle.py`
8. Same as sprite_collect_blocks.py but with a graphic instead of a block.
`sprite_collect_graphic.py`
9. Same as sprite_collect_blocks.py but with a graphic instead of a block.
`sprite_rotating.py`
10. Same idea as sprite_collect_blocks.py but uses a Game class to organize the code. This is a more advanced way of organizing the code. It helps if you want to “restart” a game once it is over.
`game_class_example.py`
11. Move a sprite around the screen with the mouse.
`move_sprite_mouse.py`
12. Move a sprite with the keyboard in discrete “jumps.”
`move_sprite_keyboard_jump.py`
13. Move a sprite with the keyboard smoothly and continuously while a key is pressed.
`move_sprite_keyboard_smooth.py`
14. Move a sprite with a game controller or joystick.
`move_sprite_game_controller.py`
15. Basic Pong game using two game controllers.
`pong.py`
16. How to manage bullets with sprites.
`bullets.py`
17. How to aim bullets.
`bullets_aimed.py`
18. Control a snake as it moves around the screen.
`snake.py`

## 1.4 Platformer examples
Progressively more complex examples for a platformer game:

1. Move a sprite around the screen, but not let it move through walls.
`move_with_walls_example.py`
2. More complex version of prior example, with multi-colored walls, and multiple rooms.
`maze_runner.py`
3. Get the player to jump off platforms.
`platform_jumper.py`
4. Like platform jumper, but scroll side to side.
`platform_scroller.py`
5. Make those platforms move!
`platform_moving.py`
6. A multi-file example that shows a platformer using sprite sheets.
See files in `sprite_sheets`
