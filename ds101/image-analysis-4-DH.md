## Check out [widipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analytics) about visual analytics.
- **Visual analytics** is an outgrowth of the fields of information visualization and scientific visualization that focuses on analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analytics).
- It can attack certain problems whose size, complexity, and need for closely coupled human and machine analysis may make them otherwise intractable.

OVERVIEW

Cultural Analytics is the analysis of massive cultural data sets and flows using computational and visualization techniques. The concept of cultural analytics was developed by Lev Manovich in 2005 and the term itself was introduced in 2007. At Software Studies Initiative we are focusing on the theoretical questions and practical research in one area of cultural analytics - using digital image processing and visualization for the exploratory analysis of large image and video collections.

Here are some of the questions which drive our work:

Theory:
- How can work with "big cultural data" can help us to question standard assumptions and concepts in humanities and social sciences? How can we combine computational techniques and analysis of massive cultural data with more traditional humanities methodologies?
- What new theoretical concepts and models do we need to deal with the mega-scale of born-digital culture?
- What would "science of culture" driven by massive data look like, and what will be its limitations?
- How we can study big cultural data without aggregating and summarizing data (the standard approach of both classical statistics and contemporary data science)?
- How can analysis of human cultural artifacts and processes focus on variability and diversity, rather than only "typical" and "most popular"?

Practice:

- How do we explore patterns in massive visual collections which may contain billions of images and video?
- How do we research interactive media processes and experiences (evolution of web design, playing a video game, etc.)?
- How to best democratize computer vision and digital image analysis techniques so they can be used by researchers and students without technical backgrounds?

To address these challenges, we are developing easy to use techniques and software for exploratory media analysis and applying them to progressively larger image and video sets. In addition to digital humanities, these techniques can be also used in cinema studies, game studies, media studies, ethnography, exhibition design, sociology, anthropology, and other fields.
