Small Projects

1. Given a text file in `.txt` format, count the number of alphabets, letters, words, and sentences. (Korean/English)
    - first try to make a small txt file using a text file editor such as notepad, pycharm, vscode, sublime, etc. 
    - Then a large file from a book or a new article.
  
    - make an automatically generated statistics report & publish it on `twitter` or `facebook`.
    - Separate a korean character into its Cho/Jung/Jong and do counting
    
1. Draw several lines, triangles, circles in a numpy WHC array, and save it to a `png` or `jpg` file.
    - Read it into numpy, display with matplotlib.pyplot
    - Do the same thing with PIL
    - Use a ttf font file to make images of characters with PIL.
    - Do research on the structure of ttf font file.
    
1. pandas dataframe. Read in IRIS csv file. 
    - Do explatory data analysis (visual inspection)
    - Choose two species, do classification with scikit-learn.
    - Read `azeleas.csv`. Report statistics of the codes in the file.
    
1. Do research on base64 encoding, provide an example.
    - convert a base64 encoded image into a numpy array.
    - generate extra column in the dataframe and put azelieas numpy char arrays.
    - find any mismatch between the code and the image. Suggest how, and report the result. Do visual inspection otherwise.

1. extract '가' and '나' to two df files.
    - Find average image, and std image
    - Find 1D representation (distance) of the images w.r.t the average image. You need to define metric between two images.
    - Display several of the largest distance images and explore.
    - develop a classifier (tree-based, SVC), report its performance.
    - accuracy vs recall, F-score
    - apply `t-SNE` analysis and display it.
